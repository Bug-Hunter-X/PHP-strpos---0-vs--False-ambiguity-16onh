This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in PHP when using the `strpos()` function.  The issue stems from the fact that `strpos()` returns `false` if the needle isn't found, but `false` also loosely evaluates to 0 in numerical contexts.  This can lead to unexpected behavior in conditional checks, especially if you don't explicitly compare against the `false` boolean value. The `bug.php` file showcases the problematic code, and `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version that utilizes strict comparison to address the problem.
